# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Elections employee has given you the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election.

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

## Resources
-Data Source: election_results.csv

-Software: Python 3.6.1, Visual Studio Code, 1.38.1

## Summary
The analysis of the election show that:

1. There were 369,711 votes cast in the election.
2. The candidates were:

    -Charles Casper Stockham
  
    -Diana DeGette
  
    -Raymon Anthony Doane
  
3. The candidate results were:

    -Charles Casper Stockham received 23.0% of the vote and 85,213 number of votes.
  
    -Diana DeGette received 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 number of votes.
  
    -Raymon Anthony Doane received 3.1% of the vote and 11,606 number of votes.
  
4. The winner of the election was:
  Diana DeGette who received 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 number of votes.
  

## Challenge Overview
### Overview of Election Audit

The purpose of this election audit analysis is to determine the winning candidate and the highest county voter turnout during a local congressional election using Python and Video Studio Code.  A breakdown of the number of votes for each county and candidate were generated.  Thus, the vote percentage for each county and candidate were then calculated and documented.

### Election-Audit Results

The results of the election analysis are listed below:

•	There were 369,711 votes cast in the election.

•	The county results were:

    -Jefferson county received 10.5% of the total vote and 38,855 number of votes.
    
    -Denver county received 82.8% of the total vote and 306,055 number of votes.
    
    -Arapahoe county received 6.7% of the total vote and 24,801 number of votes.
    
•	Jefferson county had the highest voter turnout.

•	The candidate results were:

    -Charles Casper Stockham received 23.0% of the total vote and 85,213 number of votes.
    
    -Diana DeGette received 73.8% of the total vote and 272,892 number of votes.
    
    -Raymon Anthony Doane received 3.1% of the total vote and 11,606 number of votes.
    
•	The winner of the election was Diana DeGette, who received 73.8% of the total vote and 272,892 number of votes.

## Challenge Summary
### Election-Audit Summary
The coding script used for this election audit can be modified and reformatted for other congressional elections in other states.  One part of the code that requires modification would be the path indicating the location of where to pull the raw data of election results. If additional data is recorded in the election results raw data, such as the city of each registered voter, then additional codes can be added to calculate the highest and lowest voter turnout for each city.
